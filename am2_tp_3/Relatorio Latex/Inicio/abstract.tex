This report documents the development of Activity 3 from the course unit Mathematical Analysis 2, focused on numerical methods for solving Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). Several methods are addressed, including Eulerâ€™s method, the improved Euler method (Heun), and the Runge-Kutta methods of order 2, 3, and 4, as well as the \texttt{ode45} solver from \textsc{Matlab}. Each method is presented with its corresponding mathematical formulation and a comparative analysis regarding its effectiveness, accuracy, and applicability. This activity allowed for the consolidation of both theoretical and practical knowledge in the numerical resolution of ODEs, highlighting the importance of these tools in mathematical modeling and computational simulation.
